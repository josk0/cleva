# todo
- print info / number of features in `X_train` (just to check what came through the pipeline)
- parameterize the subsampler for training data (for increasing subsample experiments)
- chunk-sample over test data (to get results on all test data even for TabPFN)
- Check: Validity of existing pipeline templates
- Learn: should use `LabelEncoder` in preprocessing to encode string features numerically? For ordinal categorical features with a meaningful order
- add parameters for models to pass through, e.g. `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200)`
- Build experiment setup using [MLXP](https://github.com/inria-thoth/mlxp)
- build saving run results as CSV or so
- place artifacts and results in sensible output path in outputs/
- build reporter â€” or link things into MLflow again
- Port cleaner and preprocessing for BAM data from Dan's project
- Build CatBoost pipeline and other functionality
